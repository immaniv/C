This is a fully functional modification of Bruce Schneier & Paul Kochers implementation of Blowfish Algorithm.

The primary purpose of this implementation is to understand the algorithm and experiment in ways to reduce the overall code size.
And a further objective is to seek improvement in performance.

The original implementation itself is highly optimized. I am afraid I haven't quite been able to realize any significant reduction
in the code size nor acheive any performance gains.

.. Experimentation continues .. 

See bf_test.c on how to use this implementation.

If you chance upon this source and have ideas on how to improve the code size and/or achieve better performance, I am all ears.
